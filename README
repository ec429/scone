scone - a flyby finder

This will eventually be a tool for finding multiple-flyby trajectories around
 the Solar System.  At the moment, however, it's just a Lambert solver that
 doesn't even work...

The Lambert solver is based on alexmoon's CoffeeScript Lambert solver,
 <https://github.com/alexmoon/ksp/blob/gh-pages/src/lambert.coffee>, but has
 been slightly simplified in the translation to C (in particular, it currently
 ignores paths longer than 1 orbit, which the original supported).
The original was licensed under Creative Commons by-nc-sa/4.0 International,
 which therefore propagates to the corresponding code in scone.
